## Speech-Emotion-Detection

This repository contains a project focused on detecting emotions from speech audio. Emotion detection in speech is crucial in various fields, including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and mental health assessment. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize and classify emotions conveyed in spoken language.

## Key Features

1. Preprocessing pipeline for audio data: Feature extraction, such as MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), spectrograms, etc.
2. Machine learning models for emotion classification: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), or hybrid models for speech emotion recognition.
3. Evaluation metrics and model performance analysis: Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, etc.
4. Example scripts for inference and real-time emotion detection.

## Dataset

The model is trained on Toronto Emotional dataset extracted from Kaggle which consists of 6 samples of audio segments annotated with fear, angry, disgust, neutral, sad, ps and happy.

## Usage

# Installation:
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt'.

# Training:
Use the provided scripts to train the emotion detection model using the dataset of your choice.

# Inference:
Employ the trained model to predict emotions from speech audio either through provided scripts or integrate it into your applications.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the project, you can:

1. Improve existing model performance.
2. Add support for new datasets.
3. Enhance documentation or create tutorials for ease of use.

## Future Enhancements:

1. Integration of the model into mobile applications or web services for real-time emotion recognition.
2. Incorporation of more advanced audio processing techniques for better feature extraction.
